frank bryce was the    he lived alone    in a cottage on the    of

hanging in the cottage far back as    i can    nobody    forced    the
no broken all frank had to do was creep up    to    the big    house

frank was stubbornly again    and that    he was and    that the

sure frank had invented
just when things    were looking very serious for the report    on

the police had never read an odder a team of doctors had the
concluded    that none    of the riddles had been or
far as they could    harmed at in    fact    report in    a tone
the riddles all appeared    to be in perfet health    from the fact
all the doctors did note though determined to find something wrong
that each of the    riddles had a    look of terror upon his    or
   whoever    heard    of three    people being    frightened to
as there was no proof    that the riddles had been murdered at    to
   frank the riddles    were    buried in the    little hangleton
   objects of curiosity    for a to and amid a cloud of
bryce    returned    to    his cottage    on the    grounds of    the
far as he killed and i care what    the police    said dot in the
hanged if    he had any leave knowing as    how we knows he did
   but frank did not he stayed    to tend the garden for    the
riddle and    then the next    neither family stayed perhaps    it
frank that the new owners said there was a    nasty feeling
started to fall into
the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither
they said in the village that he    kept it for though nobody
   these might    the wealthy owner continued to    pay frank to do
was nearing    his    seventh birthday    very his bad leg stiffer
be    seen pottering    around    the flower beds    in fine even    though
   creep up on try    as he might to suppress
weeds were not    the    only things    frank had to    contend with
   a habit    of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle
   over the    lawns frank worked so hard    to keep once or they
   house for a they knew that old devotion    to the    house
almost to an    and it    amused them    to    see him limping the
   stick and yelling croakily at    for his believed the    boys
like their parents    and though him a so when    frank awoke
   in august and    saw something very odd    up at the old he    the
gone one step further in their attempts to punish
it was bad leg that woke it    was paining him worse than ever
up and limped downstairs into the    kitchen with the idea of his
stiffness in his standing    at    the    filling the he looked    up
   saw lights    glimmering    in its upper    frank knew    at once
   had broken into the house and judging by the    flickering    quality
started a
frank    had no in any he had deeply    mistrusted the police
taken him    in    for    questioning about the    he    put down    the
   back upstairs    as fast    as his bad leg would and    was soon
and    removing a rusty old key from its hook by the he picked
was propped    against the and set off into the
   the front door of the riddle house bore    no sign of being    of
frank limped around to the back    of the house until he    reached
by took out the    old put it into the and opened the door
he    let    himself into    the cavernous frank had not entered
although    it    was very he    remembered where the door into
   groped his way towards his    nostrils full    of    the smell of
footsteps or voices from he reached    the which was a little
large    mullioned windows on either side of    the front and to
the dust that lay thick    upon the    because it    muffled    the
on    the frank    turned and saw at once    where the intruders
of the passage    a door stood and a flickering light shone    through
   of gold across the black frank edged closer    and    he was
the    room
the he    now had been    lit    in the this surprised    then
and listened for a voice spoke within the it    sounded timid
is a little more in    the my if you    are still
said a second this    too belonged to a man it was    strangely
and cold as a    sudden blast of icy something about that on
back of neck    stand me closer to the
   frank turned his right ear    toward the    the    better    to came
being put down    upon some hard and    then the dull scraping noise a
dragged across    the frank caught    a glimpse of a small his to
chair into    he    was wearing    a long black    and    there    was
then he    went out of sight
is said the cold
my said the first voice    set out to explore the i

will    milk her    before    we said the    second will    need
   the the    journey has tired me
   brow    frank inclined his good    ear    still closer to the
   was a and then the man called wormtail spoke
may i ask how long we are going to stay
   said    the cold    the place is moderately and    the
plan cannot proceed it would be foolish to act before the
frank inserted    a gnarled    finger into his ear and    rotated
   he had heard the word    which was not a word at
quidditch world my said dug    his finger    still more
vigorously into his    but    do    not understand should we wait the
   world cup is
at this very moment wizards    are pouring    into the country
and every meddler from the ministry of    magic will be    on    on
ususual checking and they will be obsessed with
lest the    muggles notice so we
frank stopped trying to    clear out his he had distinctly heard
and each of these expressions meant something
and frank could think of only    two    sorts of    people    who
   frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once and more
lordship is    still wormtail    said
i am there    was a note of menace in the cold voice
a slight    pause followed the wormtail the words tumbling    from him
   though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost
could be    done without harry my
another more and    then
   harry breathed    the second    voice
i do not say this out    of concern for the said his voice
   boy is nothing    to nothing    at it is    merely that if we were
witch    or wizard wizard thing could be done so much more if
to leave you for a short while know that i can disguise myself
back here    in    as little as two days with a suitable person
could use    another said    the cold voice is
it makes    said    sounding    thoroughly relieved hands
on harry potter would be    so he is    so    well protected
so    you volunteer to go    and fetch    me a    i perhaps    the
me has become wearisome for    could    this suggestion of the be
nothing more    than an    attempt to desert
i have no wish    to    leave none    at all
   not lie to hissed    the second    can always you are regretting
   that you ever returned    to i    revolt i see    you    flinch
when you    touch
   my devotion to your lordship
devotion    is nothing more than you would    not    be    here if
else to how    am i to survive    without when    i need feeding few

   you    seem    so much my lord
breathed the    second am no and a few days alone would be to
rob    me of the little health i    have regained under your
who had    been    sputtering    fell silent at for    a few frank
could hear nothing but    the fire the the second man spoke once    in
was almost a
   have    my reasons    for using the as    i have already to and
i have waited thirteen a few    more months will make    no as
protection surrounding the i believe my plan will be all that a
courage from wormtail you    will unless you    wish to feel the
   lord wrath
i must said panic    in his voice through our journey    i
have gone over the    plan in my head bertha disappearance    not
   unnoticed for and    if we if i murder
whispered    the second    if you follow the the    ministry need
never know    that anyone else    has you will do    it quietly i
could    do it    but    in my present one    more death and our
to harry    potter is i    am not    asking you    to do it    by
have rejoined us
am    a    faithful    said the    merest    trace of sullenness in
i need somebody with    somebody whose loyalty    has never and
fulfill neither
   found said and there was definitely a    sulky edge    to his
the one who    found    i    brought you    bertha
   is    said the second sounding    stroke of brilliance i would
thought possible from wormtail if truth    be you were not    aware
she would be when    you caught were
thought    she might    be my lord
said the second    voice the cruel amusement more pronounced than
i do not deny that    her information    was    without i could
formed our    and for    you    will have your i will    allow you
an essential task for one    that many of my followers    would

my    what wormtail sounded terrified
you    want me to spoil the your part will    come at the
but i    promise    you    will have the    honor of being    just    as
voice    suddenly    sounded as though his mouth had gone very
are to kill me
said the cold voice would    i kill i killed bertha
because i had she was fit for nothing    after    my quite in
awkward questions    would    have    been    asked if    she had gone
that she had met you    on    her wizards who are supposed to
run into ministry of magic    witches at    wayside
wormtail    muttered something so quietly that    frank could not
man laugh    entirely    mirthless cold as his
could have modified her but    memory charms    can    be    broken
as i proved when i    questioned it would be    an insult to her
information i extracted from
out    in    the frank suddenly became    aware that the hand his
   slippery    with the man    with the cold    voice had    killed
   without any kind    of remorse he was dangerous    and he was
planning    more    murders harry    whoever    he was    in danger
frank knew what    he    must if    was the time to    go to the
out of the house and head    straight for the telephone    box
speaking    and frank    remained where he frozen    to    the with
   more my faithful    servant at harry potter    is    as good as
it    is there will be no more    but i think i hear
and the    second voice he started making    noises such    as frank
   he    was hissing and spitting without drawing frank thought    he
some sort of fit or
   and then frank heard movement behind him in the    dark he to
   found himself paralyzed with
something was slithering    toward him along the    dark corridor
sliver of    he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a
frank stared as its undulating body    cut    a curving track
the    thick dust on the    coming closer and closer was he to    the
   escape was into the    room where the two men sat plotting    yet
the    snake would    surely kill him
but    before he    had made his the snake was level    with and
it    was it was following the hissing noises made by    the
beyond the    and    in    the tip    of its tail    had vanished

there    was sweat on    forehead and the hand    on the    walking
inside the the cold    voice was continuing to and frank was
impossible this man could talk to
   frank understand what was going he wanted more than anything to
bed with his the problem was    that his legs seem to want to
stood there shaking and    trying to master the    cold voice to

has interesting it
my    said
   said the    to there is an    old    muggle standing right
outside this listening    to    every word    we
frank have a chance to hide there were footsteps and    then the
   was    flung wide
a balding man with    graying a    pointed and    watery    eyes stood
a    mixture    of fear    and alarm in his
him where are your
the cold voice    was coming from the ancient armchair before the
the    the    on    the other was curled up on the rotting hearth
   horrible travesty    of a    pet
wormtail    beckoned frank    into the though still deeply frank
on his walking stick and limped over    the
the    fire was    the    only source of light in the it    cast    upon
frank stared at the back    of the    the man inside it seemed to
for frank even see    the back of    his
heard said the cold
that calling said frank for    now that he was inside the
now that the time had come for some    sort    of    he felt

i am not a said    the cold barely audible    now over    the of
   the    am much more than    a    why i will face

the    servant gave a
heard
with his face    screwed as though he would rather have done    than
his master and the hearth rug where the snake the small man    and
turn the the snake lifted its    ugly triangular    head and    hissed
snagged on its
and then the chair was facing and    he saw what was sitting in
to the floor with a he opened his mouth and    let out a
   that he never    heard the words the thing in the    chair as
green    a rushing and frank bryce he    was    dead before he hit
   two hundred    miles the boy called    harry potter woke with a
   chapter two
   the scar
harry    lay flat on his breathing hard    as though    he had been
a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his the old scar
shaped like    a bolt of was burning    beneath    his    fingers    as
pressed    a wire to his
he sat one    hand still on his    the other hand    reaching
which were    on    the    bedside    he    put them on and his bedroom
a misty orange    light    that    was filtering through the the

harry ran    his fingers over    the scar it was still    he turned
scrambled out of crossed the opened his and peered    into the
   inside of the a skinny    boy of fourteen    looked back at    his
under his untidy black he examined the scar of his reflection
   looked    but it was still
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before
there had been    two people    he knew and one he concentrated
trying to
the    dim    picture of a    darkened room came to there had    been a
small    man called nicknamed and a high the voice of lord
harry felt as though    an ice cube    had slipped    down into    his
he    closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what had    but
all harry    knew    was that at the moment    when chair had
   and had seen what was sitting in he had felt a spasm    of
or had that been the pain in his
and who had    the old    man for there had definitely been
him fall    to the    it was all becoming harry put    his face
out    his trying to hold on to the picture    of that dimly lit
keep water in his    cupped the details    were now trickling as
   to    voldemort and wormtail    had been    talking    about someone
   ry could    not remember    the and    they    had been plotting
harry    took his face out of his opened his and stared around his
expecting to see    something unusual as it there    was an number
unusual    things in    this    a large wooden trunk    stood open a
black and assorted rolls of parchment    littered    that    part
of his desk that was    not taken up by the empty    cage in    which
usually on    the floor beside his    bed a book lay harry had
fell asleep last    the pictures in    this    book were    all men
zooming in and out of sight on    throwing a    red    ball to
   harry walked    over to the picked it and watched on    of the    a
   goal by putting the ball through a then he snapped the    book
quidditch    the best sport    in    the world distract him    at
he placed    flying with    the cannons on his bedside crossed    to
the curtains to survey    the street
privet drive looked    exactly as a respectable suburban street
early    hours of saturday    all the    curtains    were as    far
the there a living creature in not    even    a
and and harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on
over his scar it the    pain that bothered harry was no stranger
he had    lost    all the bones from his right arm once    and had
   same arm had    been pierced by a venemous fang not    long    only
ry    had    fallen    fifty feet from an airborn he was used    to
they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school    of and and
knack for attracting    a lot of
the    thing that was    bothering harry was    the last time his
cause    voldemort    had been close but voldemort be    the idea
   mort lurking in    privet drive was
   harry listened closely to the silence around    was he    half
   stair or the swish of a    and then he jumped    slightly as
   tremendous grunting snore    from the next
harry shook    himself    he    was being there was no one in    the
except    uncle aunt and and they were plainly still    their dreams
untroubled and
   asleep    was the    way harry liked the dursleys it as though any
to    him    uncle    aunt and dudley    were    only living they
were muggles who hated and despised magic in any which meant
   welcome in    their    house    as dry they    had    explained away
over the    last three years    by    telling everyone that he went
   bly criminal they knew perfectly well as    an underage    harry
to use magic outside but    they were still apt    to    blame    him
about    the harry had never been able to confide    in    them
in the wizarding the very idea of    going to    them    when they
his scar hurting    and    about his worries about was
and yet it    was because    of voldemort    that    harry had to
   if it been for harry would    not have had the    lightning on
if it    been    for harry would    still have had
   harry    had been a    year old the night that    voldemort    for
a wizard who had    been    gaining    power steadily    for eleven
killed    his father and voldemort had then turned his wand
curse that had    disposed of many witches    and wizards in his to
it had    not instead of killing the    small the curse had    upon
harry had survived with nothing but a shaped cut    on his    and
   demort had    been reduced to something barely his powers his
voldemort had the terror in which the    secret community of and
had lived for so long    had    followers had and harry potter had
come
   it had been enough of    a shock    for harry to on his    that
it    had been    even more disconcerting    to find out that in
   world knew    his harry    had arrived    at hogwarts to find that
lowed him    wherever he but he was    used to it at the end
   starting his    fourth year at and    harry was    already the
back at the castle
but there    was still a fortnight to go before he went back to
around    his room and his eye paused on the birthday cards
at the    end of what    would they say if harry wrote to

at    hermione voice seemed to fill    his shrill and
scar really    write to professor    and go and
   check common magical ailments and maybe something in there about

that would be go straight    to the headmaster    of and in the
   consult a harry    stared    out of the window at the inky
very much whether a book could help him as far as    he he was
   to have    survived a curse    like it was highly that he    would
symptoms listed in common    magical ailments and as for informing
   harry had    no idea where    dumbledore went during the summer
   picturing    with his long    silver full length and    pointed
stretched out    on a beach rubbing    suntan lotion    onto his
rever dumbledore harry was sure that hedwig would be able to
owl had never    yet failed to deliver a letter to even without

dear    professor sorry to bother but my    scar hurt    this yours
   harry
even inside    his    head    the words    sounded
and so he    tried    to imagine his other best ron    and in    a
red    hair and    freckled    face seemed    to swim    before a

scar but be near    you can i mean
be trying to do    you    in i maybe curse
   scars always twinge a    ask
   weasley    was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse
fice    at the    ministry of but    he have    any    particular in
far as harry    in any harry like the idea of    the whole
that    was getting jumpy about a few weasley    would fuss worse
   than and fred and twin might    think    harry was
losing his the weasleys    were favorite family    in the    he was
might invite    him to    stay    any time    now had mentioned the
and he    somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries
harry kneaded his    forehead with his what he    really wanted it
shameful to admit    it    to was someone    like like a an
advice he could ask without feeling someone who cared about    who
rience    with    dark
and    then the    solution    came    to    it was so    and so    that
had taken so    long
harry    leapt    up from the hurried    across    the and sat at
piece of    parchment    toward loaded    his quill with wrote    dear
wondering    how best    to phrase his still marveling at    the
   thought of sirius    straight    but    perhaps it    so surprising
found out    that sirius was his    godfather    two months

lamp    seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light    that
into    the    when the sun had when his bedroom walls had    turned
when sounds of movement    could    be heard    from uncle vernon
cleared his desk of    crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his

chapter    three
   the    invitation

by the time harry arrived in    the    the three dursleys were
   none    of them looked up    as he entered or sat    uncle
behind the daily and aunt petunia was    cutting    a grapefruit
pursed over her    horselike
dudley looked furious    and    and    somehow seemed    to be taking
this    was saying as    he always took    up    an entire    side
when aunt petunia put a quarter of    unsweetened grapefruit a
mulous    you diddy dudley    glowered at his life    had    taken
pleasant turn since he had come home    for the    summer with
uncle vernon and aunt petunia had    managed to    find excuses
petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose
while uncle    vernon maintained    that want some    swotty    little
they also skated    over    the    accusations of bullying in the a
but he hurt a aunt    petunia had    said
at the bottom of the report there were a few comments    from
nurse that not even uncle    vernon and aunt    petunia could no
aunt petunia wailed    that dudley was and that his poundage
that    he was    a    growing boy who needed    plenty of the
stock    knickerbockers big enough for him the    school    nurse
eyes    sharp when it came    to spotting fingerprints    on her
serving the comings and goings of    the neighbors refused    to that
extra dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of    a young
so    many after arguments that shook bedroom and many tears
   from aunt petunia    new regime had the diet sheet that    had
ings school nurse had    been taped to the    which had    been of
things    drinks and chocolate bars and burgers and filled    with
tables and the sorts    of things that uncle vernon called to
about it    aunt    petunia had insisted that    the whole    family
grapefruit quarter    to he noticed that    it was a lot    smaller
seemed to feet that the    best way to    keep up    morale    was
get    more    to eat than
but    aunt petunia know what was hidden under the    loose she
idea that    harry was not following the diet at the moment he
   was expected to survive the summer on carrot harry had sent to
pleas for and they    had risen to the occasion hedwig had    from
   house    with a large box stuffed full    of parents were
the    hogwarts had obliged with    a sack full    of    his own
touched he    had    had too much experience of

poor who    was elderly    and    had needed a full five days to the
and then    on birthday the dursleys    had completely he had
ceived    four superb birthday    one each from and harry still
had    two of them and looking    forward to a    real breakfast
his grapefruit without
uncle    vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of and
grapefruit
   this    he said grumpily to aunt
   aunt petunia gave him a severe and then nodded pointedly at
finished his own grapefruit quarter and was    eyeing with a

tie
   uncle vernon    gave a great    which ruffled his    bushy and up

the doorbell uncle vernon heaved himself out of his    chair    and
quick    as    a while his    mother was occupied    with the of

harry    heard talking at    the    and someone    and    uncle vernon
then the    front door    and the sound of ripping    paper came
aunt petunia set the teapot    down on the table and looked to
vernon    had got    she have to wait    long to    find after a
   looked
he barked at the living
   wondering what on earth    he was supposed to have done this
   and followed    uncle vernon    out of    the kitchen    and into
door sharply    behind    both of
he marching over    to the fireplace and turning    to face harry
to pronounce    him    under
harry would have dearly loved to have    but he feel that uncle
temper should be tested this    early in    the especially when
strain from lack    of    he therefore settled for looking
just said uncle he brandished    a piece of purple writing paper
about
   confusion    who would be writing to uncle vernon about who
   know who sent letters by the
   uncle vernon glared at then looked down    at the    letter    and
dear and
   we have never been but i    am sure    you have heard a deal
my son
as harry    might have told    the final of the quidditch world
and my    has just    managed to    get    prime tickets through
the department    of    magical    games and
i do    hope    you will allow us to    take harry    to the as    a
britain hosted    the cup    for thirty    and tickets are    extremely
   we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the    of
   see him    safely onto the train back to
it would    be best for harry to send    us your answer as quickly
because the    muggle postman has never    delivered to our and i am
   where it
   hoping    to see    harry
   yours
molly weasley

uncle vernon finished put his hand back    into his    breast and out
thing
at he
he    held up the envelope    in which letter had and    harry    had
a every    bit    of    it was covered    in    stamps except for a    on

weasley    had squeezed the address in minute
did put    enough stamps said    trying to sound as though
was    a mistake anyone could his eyes
postman he said through gritted    interested to    know where
ter came he why he rang the seemed to    think it was
harry    say other people might    not understand    why uncle vernon
   a fuss about too many but harry    had lived with    the    too
   touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the
someone    would    find out    that    they were    connected with like

uncle vernon was still    glaring at    who tried to    keep his if
   do    or    say    anything he might    just be in for    the    treat
non to    say    but he merely continued    to    harry    decided to
i    go    he
a slight spasm crossed    uncle large purple    the mustache
he knew what was going on behind    the a furious battle as two
fundamental instincts came into allowing harry to go would
thing    uncle    vernon had struggled against for    thirteen on
disappear    to    the for the rest of the summer would get rid
anyone could have and uncle vernon    hated having    harry in
   thinking it he looked down at letter
is this he staring at the signature with
   seen said    my    friend she was    meeting him off the
hog    the school    train at the    end of    last
he had    almost said and that was a sure way    to    get    his
nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud    in the dursley
uncle vernon screwed    up his    enormous face    as though to

sort of he growled of children with red
   harry he thought it was a    bit    rich of    uncle vernon    to
own had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age
   and become    wider than he was
   uncle vernon was perusing the letter
he muttered under his is    this
harry felt a second stab of
a    he said    on
all said uncle vernon    harry with    some that    his
cle looked    vaguely apparently his    nerves    stand the sound of
in his    living he took refuge in    perusing the letter harry
words us your    answer the normal    he
   does she normal he
   for said and before    his uncle could stop he owl
   normal for
uncle vernon looked    as outraged as if harry had just    uttered
with he shot    a nervous look through the as though expecting
neighbors with their ears    pressed against    the
many times do i have to tell    you not to mention    that under
his face now    a    rich    plum stand in    the clothes petunia and
your ungrateful back
after dudley finished with said harry and he was dressed    in

sweatshirt    so large    for him that    he had    had    to roll so
   use his    and which fell past    the    knees    of his baggy
will not be spoken to    like said    uncle trembling with
   but harry going    to stand for gone were the days    when he to
every single one of the    stupid he following and he
going to let uncle vernon stop    him from going to the world
harry    took a    steadying    breath and then i see the world can i
only got a    letter to sirius    i want to    you know
he had done he    had said the magic now he watched the purple from
uncle    making it look like badly mixed black currant ice
writing to    are said uncle in    a calm    voice
   harry    had seen the pupils of    his tiny eyes contract with
said been    a    while since he    heard from you
if he he might start thinking
   he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these    he could almost
   der    uncle neatly parted if he tried to    stop harry    writing
   rius would think    harry was being if he told harry he go
world harry would    write    and tell who would know    harry was
there was only    one    thing for    uncle vernon to    harry see
mind as though the great mustached face were harry    tried to
keep his own    face as blank as and then
   all right you can go to this ruddy stupid world cup you write
and tell these weasleys to pick you    i got time    to go
you    off all over    the    and    you    can    spend the rest of
your godfather    him    him
said harry
he    turned and walked toward the    living room fighting the to
he    was going was going    to the he    was    going to    watch
world
outside in the    hall he nearly ran    into who had been the
hoping to    overhear harry being told    he looked    shocked to
   was    an    excellent    said feel really
laughing    at the astonished    look    on harry    took the stairs a
hurled    himself back into    his
the first thing he saw was that hedwig    was    she was    sitting
with her enormous amber    and clicking her    beak in the way
about exactly    what was    annoying her became    apparent almost
said harry as what appeared to be a feathery tennis ball
the side of his harry massaged the spot looking    up    to
saw a    minute small enough to fit into the    palm of his the
   room    like a loose harry then realized that the owl    had a at
bent recognized then    tore open    the    inside was a hastily
scribbled
harry got the    tickets versus    monday writing
to the muggles    to ask you to    they might already have    the
muggle post thought send this with    pig
harry stared at    the    word then    looked up    at the tiny owl
   fixture    on the he had never    seen    anything that looked    a

read he went back to    the
coming for you whether the muggles    like it or    you    miss
   mum and dad reckon better if we pretend    to    ask    their
pig back with your answer and come and get you at five    on
   say send pig back pronto    and    come and    get you    at five on
arriving this started work department of international
magical mention anything about abroad while    here unless    you
the pants bored off

harry said    as the    small    owl    flew low over    his madly
harry could    only assume was pride at having delivered    the    to
i need    you to take my    answer
   the owl    fluttered down    on    top of    hedwig looked    coldly
   ing it    to    try and come    any
harry    seized his    quill once grabbed a fresh    piece of and
   all the muggles say    i can see you five

he folded this note up    very and with immense tied it    to the
hopped on the spot with the moment the    note was the owl
zoomed out of the window and    out of
harry turned to
up    to a long he asked
hedwig hooted in a    dignified sort of a
   you take this    to sirius for he    picking up his on just

he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a

the    letter he    tied it to she kept unusually    as though
show him how a    real    post    owl should
be at when you get all harry told
   she nipped his finger with    a soft swooshing    spread her
wings    and soared    out    of the open
harry    watched her    out of then crawled under his wrenched    up
and    pulled out    a    large chunk of birthday he sat    there

harry felt a slight sense of he had rarely seen    or weasley
   thing that the dursleys would call their children might    don
but and weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of

dursleys    might be to    the    weasleys if    they turned up like
uncle vernon had put on his best    to some this might have a
of but harry    knew it was    because uncle vernon wanted to

   he and    ron exchanged glances and then    quickly    looked
to burst out laughing was almost dudley was still clutching
afraid    it might fall seemed genuinely concerned at peculiar
   from    the tone of his voice when he next harry was quite
weasley thought dudley was quite as mad    as the dursleys thought
ley felt    sympathy rather than
a    good he said
   dudley harry saw his hands tighten    still harder over    his
fred    and george came back into    the room carrying school they
as they    entered    and spotted their    faces cracked into    identical

he    pushed    up the sleeves of his robes and took out    his
   back against the wall as
   said    pointing his wand at the hole    in    the wall behind
flames rose at    once in    the crackling merrily as though they
   weasley took a small drawstring bag from    his    untied took
powder and threw it onto the which turned emerald    green and

   said    no    on
a bag    of    sweets had spilled    out of pocket    and    the    were
rection fat toffees in    brightly colored
fred scrambled cramming    them back into his then    gave the a
stepped and walked right    into    the saying aunt    petunia gave
little shuddering there    was a whooshing and fred
said and the
   harry helped george carry the    trunk    forward into    the flames
   could hold it with a second george had    cried and vanished

the    shouted and
now harry and weasley alone
   harry said to the

the    weasley    put out a    hand and held him he    was looking

   wand was    still in    his and uncle tiny eyes darted    to

   he    very
   said putting one foot    forward into the green    which felt
   like warm at that    a    horrible gagging sound erupted and
aunt petunia    started to
   harry wheeled    dudley    was no    longer standing behind    his
   beside the    coffee    and he was gagging    and sputtering on a
was protruding from his one bewildered second harry    realized
thing was tongue that a brightly colored toffee    wrapper lay

   aunt petunia hurled herself onto    the ground beside seized
and attempted    to wrench it out    of    his dudley yelled and
worse    than trying    to    fight her    uncle vernon was and his
and weasley had to    shout to make    himself
to    i can sort    him    he advancing    on dudley with    his wand
but aunt    petunia screamed worse than ever    and    threw    herself
from

fred practical joker only    an engorgement charm i think it is

bellowing    like a wounded uncle vernon snatched up another
just    weasley his wand on    uncle sort    this
harry want    to    miss    the but uncle second ornament narrowly
left    and on    balance he thought    it    best    to leave    the
the    looking over his shoulder as he    said his    last glimpse
room was of weasley    blasting a third ornament out of uncle
aunt petunia    screaming and lying on top    of and tongue lolling
great slimy but next moment harry had begun to spin very    and
   room was    whipped out of sight in a rush of
chapter    five
wizard wheezes
harry    spun faster and    elbows tucked tightly to his blurred
until    he started to feel sick    and    closed his when at last
he threw out his hands and came    to a halt    in    time to from
ward out    of the kitchen
he eat said fred holding out a    hand    to pull harry to his
said straightening was

bill    got    to his and also shook bill came as something of
harry knew that he worked    for the wizarding    and    that bill
harry had always    imagined bill    to be an    older version    of
   breaking and fond of bossing everyone bill    was was    no other
it    he was    with long hair    that he had    tied back in a
ring    with what looked    like a fang dangling from clothes not
place at a rock except that harry recognized    his boots to    be
dragon
before any of them    could say anything there was a faint
appeared out of thin air at he was looking angrier than    harry

weasley harry    could tell however angry he    was    with fred he
really intended    to tell weasley what had there was    a    while

weasley slammed    a large    copper    saucepan    down    on the
   her wand around inside a creamy sauce poured    from    the wand
not as    though they got she continued    taking the saucepan over
the    stove and lighting it with a further poke of    her and
   they pull    themselves together be    in real had more owls

about them than the rest put if they carry    on the    way    end

ron said    hurriedly to seizing    a    handful of cutlery from
go and help bill and
   they left    weasley and headed    out    the back door into
they    had only gone a few    paces when ginger
came pelting out of the tail held high in    the chasing    what
muddy    potato on harry    recognized it instantly as a barely
little feet    pattered    very fast    as it sprinted across the yard
lington boots that    lay scattered around the harry    could hear
crookshanks inserted a paw    into the trying to reach a
noise was coming from the other    side of the the source of the

two battered old tables fly high above the    smashing into each
knock    the out of the    fred and george were ginny was and
mione was    hovering near the apparently torn between amusement    and
table    caught with a huge    bang and knocked one of    its legs
   ter    from and    they all looked up to see head poking out of
second
you keep it he
said    the cauldron bottoms coming
said percy and he slammed    the window    bill and
charlie    directed the tables    safely onto    the end to    and
   bill reattached the table    leg    and conjured tablecloths from
   by seven    the two tables were groaning under dishes and    dishes
cellent and the    nine and    hermione were settling themselves to
eat beneath a    to    somebody    who    had    been living on meals
stale cake all this    was and at harry listened rather than as
helped himself to chicken and ham boiled and
at the far    end of the percy was telling    his father all on

got quite    enough on our plates at the department of magical
trying to    find    members of other    departments    as you got
ganize right after    the    world
   percy cleared    his throat significantly and looked    down toward
   and hermione were know the one talking he raised his
voice
ron rolled his eyes and    muttered    to    harry and been    trying
what that event    is ever since he started probably    an exhibition

in the    middle of    the    weasley    was arguing with    bill
seemed    to be a recent
   with a horrible    great    fang on what do    they say at the

   down to three hundred and ninety to said charlie
ing and wales    lost    to and    scotland was slaughtered    by

and    owned one of the    best    racing    brooms in the a flying
harry than anything else in the    magical and    he played in the
gryffindor house
   weasley    conjured    up candles to light the    darkening garden
made    strawberry    ice and    by the    time they    had moths    were
and the warm    air was perfumed with the smells    of grass    and
   ing extremely    well fed and at peace with the world as he

   through    the laughing madly and closely pursued    by
   ron looked carefully up the table to check    that the rest of
he    said    very quietly    to you    heard from    sirius
hermione looked    listening
said harry he sounds i    wrote to him he    might    write
back while
he    suddenly remembered the reason    he had written to    and    a
   verge    of telling ron and hermione about his scar    hurting
awoken    him    he really    want to    worry them just    not
so happy    and
at the    weasley said checking her really should

said    weasley and they all
said in    an    innocent tone that deceived

he had    never    really thought much about    those in other
their fellow campers were starting to wake first to stir
harry had never    seen witches and wizards this young a tiny

mingling with the    little yells bust you bust
a short    way    farther they saw two little barely older than
toy    broomsticks that rose only    high enough for the toes to a
wizard    had already spotted as he hurried past    and hermione he
broad    parents having a i suppose
here and there adult wizards and witches    were    emerging from to

from the    inside of tents they and though    he understand
single voice was

   really young only just eighteen or a you wait
til

   there    was    already a small queue for the    tap in the
mione joined right    behind a    pair of men who were    having
a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery the other    was
   he was holding out    a    pair of pinstriped    trousers and    with

   women    wear not    the they wear said    the    ministry
   and    he brandished the pinstriped
not    putting them said old    archie in    like    a healthy    breeze

hermione    was overcome    with such a strong    fit    of the    at
   out of the queue    and only    returned when archie had    collected
walking more slowly    because of the    weight    of    the they
   through    the here and they saw more familiar    other with
their oliver the old captain    of house quidditch who had just
dragged harry over to his tent to introduce and told him that he
had just been signed to the    puddlemere    united    reserve next
a    hufflepuff fourth and a little farther on they saw cho a
   who    played seeker on the ravenclaw she waved    and smiled
   lot of water down his front    as    he waved more to stop ron
harry    hurriedly    pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he
reckon they he go to do
they    go to    some foreign said    know there    are never met
who went    to bill had    a penfriend at a school in brazil was
   he wanted    to go on    an exchange trip but mum and dad    his
all offended when he said he    going and    sent him a cursed it
harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about
he now that    he saw representatives of    so many in the    he
had    been stupid    never to realize    that hogwarts be the only
   who    looked    utterly unsurprised    by the    no doubt she had
other wizarding    schools in some book or
been said george when    they    finally    got back    to the
a few said setting the water not    got that    fire    started
having fun with the    said
weasley was having no success at all    in lighting the but it of
splintered    matches littered the ground around but    he as
time of his
he said as he managed to    light a    match and promptly dropped
said hermione taking    the box    from    and showing him
how    to do    it
at last they got    the fire though it was at least another

they were halfway through    their plates of eggs and sausages when
waving    and    grinning at a man who was striding toward    he
the
   ludo bagman    was easily the most noticeable person harry had    seen
archie in his flowered he was wearing long quidditch robes    in
stripes of    bright yellow and an    enormous picture    of a
   he had    the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly
across a large belly he surely had not had    in the days he
   his nose    was squashed broken by a stray harry    but    his
short blond and rosy    complexion made him look like a very
   bagman called he was walking    as though he    had springs to
the balls of    his feet and    was plainly in    a state of

him got such    good    tickets
bagman    beamed    and waved his hand as if to say it had
a flutter on    the he    said jingling what seemed to be a
   amount of gold in the pockets    of his    already    got roddy

percy    threw fred an extremely nasty look    and    stoked    the
